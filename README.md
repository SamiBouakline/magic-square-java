# Magic Square (Java Swing)

An interactive Java Swing implementation of a 3×3 Magic Square puzzle 
designed to explore event-driven programming, GUI design, and game logic.

## Overview
This project demonstrates building an interactive puzzle game in Java. 
Players fill a 3×3 grid with the numbers 1–9 so that each number is used 
exactly once and all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

The goal of the project was to practice **Java Swing**, **event-driven design**, 
and **validating game state** in a small interactive application.

## Features
- Interactive 3×3 grid
- Real-time validation of moves
- Automatic win detection
- Color-coded tiles for feedback

## Technical Concepts
- Java Swing layouts and components
- Event-driven programming with ActionListeners
- Game state validation and logic
- Translating 2D grid logic into arrays

## How to Run
Compile and run with a single command:
```bash
javac *.java && java MagicSquare
